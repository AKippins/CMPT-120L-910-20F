<p>This was surprisingly a very easy step-by-step process to follow.
The Markdown Guide was very simple to follow. On top of that, I broke off from it as well.
After reading the basics guide, I used the toolbar on the side to navigate through the lab.
It was easy to go from step to step, like https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs-1
for example. I can see how this could help not only organize your work in labs and work,
but also make it look great, and more professional. </p>
