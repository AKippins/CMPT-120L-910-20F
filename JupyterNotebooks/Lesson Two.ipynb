    "Variables are going to be our bread and butter in a lot of scenarios. Similar to in math Variables can hold significant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also similar to using them in math, the name of the variable goes on the left and then there's an assign statement which is `=`, then on the right side of the variable comes what the variable is supposed to represent. What's different is that our variables in the programming world can hold much more than numbers.\n",

    "_*It's super important that you remember that the assign symbol is a SINGLE `=`, as we move on there will be other symbols that use more than one equals signs or a combination of symbols_\n",

    "\n",
    "Why this is important right now is because we need to remember that a user will have to interact with what we're doing in some way shape or form. In most instances we can simulate this but for the purpose of transparancy we'll go over it.\n",

    "This section is going to revisit something that we saw above. So i went through a bunch of ways to define different variables above. There are a bunch of different data types and those data types have built in functions that are available to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "---\n",
    "Strings are our primary ways to send messages. Started with either `'' or \"\"` quotes surround strings and they can't be mismatched. There are instances where you need to use quotes inside of quotes and that's done using an escape character. That escape character is `\\`. Now if you open with one the other can be use freely. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'This is a string.'\n",
    "\"This is also a string.\"\n",
    "'She said, \"This is a string\"'\n",
    "\"That's a nice string that you have there.\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are all valid strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers(Numbers) & Longs\n",
    "---\n",
    "Integers are our prime representation of numbers. These are fairly simple and are probably the easiest to pickup. The difference between Integers and Longs in a simplistic sense is that ints are only numbers that persist under the possible numbers in the range from `-2^31 - 2^31` so about negative 2 billion to positive 2 billion. Longs are numbers outside that range. So that'd be `-2^63 - 2^63`. This isn't something that you have to handle in Python but is good to know about. \n",
    "```\n",
    "10\n",
    "2020\n",
    "1000000001\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are all examples of valid numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Floats & Doubles \n",
    "---\n",
    "Floats and Doubles are just ways to represent decimals. They have the same trope as the integers and the longs. 32bit vs 64bit.\n",
    "\n",
