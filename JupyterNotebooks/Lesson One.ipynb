    "Topics for today will include:\n",
    "- Syllabus\n",
    "- Welcome to CMPT 120\n",
    "- What is Computer Science\n",
    "    - Hardware vs Software\n",
    "    - How Do Computers Work?\n",

    "### Welcome to CMPT 120!\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course I'll be teaching you introductory and eventually some upper level and more advanced topics related to computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this course lesson notes will primarily be hosted using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/index.html). I don't expect you as intro students to be proficent with them but I do want you to become familiar with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Jupyter Notebooks we can:\n",
    "- Have notes for each lesson. \n",
    "- Have a place where we can see how code executes.\n",
    "- Have an interactive space for students to be able to rerun things seen in lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware vs Software\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the world of computing we have 2ish realms. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware\n",
    "- Software\n",
    "- Firmware (ish)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic sense, we have hardware which is our physical. This is made up of servers, storage, memory, mainfraimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of those things we also have physical components that go into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have software which is code. This is where we do things like programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, hacking, cybersecurity, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Languages\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We have several languages that we can use. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- Javascript\n",
    "- Java\n",
    "- C\n",
    "- C++\n",
    "- C#\n",
    "- Objective C\n",
    "- Assembler\n",
    "- Ruby\n",
    "- Go\n",
    "- So on and so forth...\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages have different uses for different things. Some are used for websites, some are great at making video games, some work well with banks and protecting valuable information. \n",
    "\n",
    "People typicallly pick up different languages depending on the things that they choose to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "- Scripting Languages\n",
    "- Object Oriented Languages\n",
    "- Functional Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of them has strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Computer Science is Relevant\n",
    "Computer science is everywhere in the form of websites, apps, calculators, data science, quantum computing, cloud, video games, art, sciences, geological studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many fields that are benifiting from the aid of CS. It's becoming more and more prevelant as time goes on. It's become a consumable way for people to transform and modernize their mediums for a more modern audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potiential of all the the possible parings are unimaginable. Our roles are to bridge those gaps and make things more attainable for those that come next. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers and Expressions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So in programming we have Identifiers and Expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers are fairly simple they're the names that we have for things and that we give to things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions on the other hand are a little more complex they resemble something that we want our identifiers to equate to. We'll start to get into this and much more next class. \n",
